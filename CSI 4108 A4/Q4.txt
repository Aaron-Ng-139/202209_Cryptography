Q4)
It is possible to implement a hash function in block ciphers like DES because DES is a Feistel Cipher.
Feistel ciphers use round functions during both encrypting and decrypting.
However for decrypting in Feistel ciphers, we do not need to invert the function,
we simply use the same round keys as encryption but in reverse order.
Since we never need to invert the function, a non-reversible (or one-way) function can be used.
This is how block ciphers like DES can make use of hash functions.
